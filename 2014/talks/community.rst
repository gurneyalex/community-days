How to contribute within the Community (OCA) project
====================================================

Abstract: 

This talk will give you a clear explanation on how to contribute to the OpenERP
Community projects on Launchpad, including how to use bazaar in a productive
way. I will explain what is hidden behind the acronyms OCB (OpenERP Community
Backports) and OCA (OpenERP Community Addons) and how these projects can help
you in your OpenERP implementations. And since this is about the Community, I
shall explain how you can contribute to OCB and OCA (bug reports, merge
proposals, code reviews...)

notes from mail

* Version <= 7.0 keep Launchpad as a reference. We eventually setup a replication in github (lp -> gituhub) in a couple of weeks

 * We do use one organization on github for the whole community work
 
 * We create one team on github per area of expertize (so that means like it is now on LP). I tried to see if we can lower the number of team, but wasn't able to decide how to merge them. Any though here, the list is here :https://launchpad.net/~openerp-community-reviewer/+participation ?

 * Every LP project become a repository on github. The branches hosted under the community reviewer team (bazaar extractor, etc..) will have a new repo called something like "community toolkit".

 * Branches represent the serie (like OpenERP did with odoo)

The only disadvantage I see here is that we cannot include a team in a team on github. So that means, we'll no longer have a community reviewer team that is part of all other team. We'll need to add in every team the right people, but apart from a bit of "administrative" work, it'll be ok.

As Nhomar pointed out, I already took the time to create this organization on github : https://github.com/OdooCommunity

It was a first test from me, but if you agree, I'll spend some time to create the team and repos. I suggest also that I make an OCA-board team with the administration right on the organization. So current OCA board member will be able to administrate the organization as well.
