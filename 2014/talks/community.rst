How to contribute within the Community (OCA) project
====================================================

Abstract: 

This talk will give you a clear explanation on how to contribute to the OpenERP
Community projects on Launchpad, including how to use bazaar in a productive
way. I will explain what is hidden behind the acronyms OCB (OpenERP Community
Backports) and OCA (OpenERP Community Addons) and how these projects can help
you in your OpenERP implementations. And since this is about the Community, I
shall explain how you can contribute to OCB and OCA (bug reports, merge
proposals, code reviews...)
